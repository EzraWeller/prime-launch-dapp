### 1. Why should I use Prime Launch for my token sale?
Prime Launch offers two launch types:
1. Seed Launches, which have the simplicity of private sales and aren't offered elsewhere.
2. Liquid Launches (coming soon), which offer the best user experience for launching with Balancer V2's innovative Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools.

In addition to the main features, Prime Launch is owned and operated by a DAO, Prime DAO, which comes with a number of benefits (decentralization, stakeholder ownership, transparency). When you use Prime Launch, the Prime Network is buying into your launch and makes a number of other services and products available to you, such as shared liquidity pooling, R&D, developing, and communications support.

### 2. How is Prime Launch governed and operated? Who owns Prime Launch?
Prime Launch is owned and operated by Prime DAO, which funded Prime Launch's development and appoints the signers on the Prime Launch multi-sig. The multi-sig is responsible for approving new launches to appear in the Prime Launch interface.

### 3. Can I request support services from Prime DAO without launching on Prime Launch?
Yes! You can find out about the other projects and services Prime DAO offers <a href="/documentation/prime-support">here</a>, and you can inquire about them in the <a href="https://daotalk.org/c/primedao/38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prime Forum</a>.

### 4. Does Prime Launch plan to support other networks?
TODO

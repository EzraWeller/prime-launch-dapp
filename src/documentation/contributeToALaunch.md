To contribute to a launch and receive tokens, follow the steps outlined below. 

1. Have a compatible wallet setup. Prime Launch connects to most Ethereum wallets, including Metamask and all wallets compatible with WalletConnect. If you don't have an Ethereum wallet yet, set up a <a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metamask account</a> or use a WalletConnect-enabled mobile wallet like <a href="https://rainbow.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow</a> or <a href="https://www.argent.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argent</a>.
2. Next up, you will need to fund your wallet with the of tokens you want to contribute to the Launch and some ETH for paying transaction costs (~$25 worth of ETH is safe). Most wallets will give you instructions on how to do this. 
4. On the <a href="/launches">Launches page</a>, you can view the upcoming launches and see which tokens the project is accepting in its launch.

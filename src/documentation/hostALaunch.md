To host a Launch via Prime Launch, you will need to follow the application process. Please follow the below steps to apply or request support from a Prime Launch Representative by filling out <a href="https://hi704760.typeform.com/to/TPMzQKFE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>.

## Application Process

1. Go to the <a href="/launch">application page</a> to get started. 
2. Choose Seed or Liquid launch, then follow the steps in the registration process and fill in all relevant data. When in doubt, don't hesitate to reach out to a Prime Launch Representative through the <a href="https://hi704760.typeform.com/to/TPMzQKFE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">help form</a>. After filling in and checking your submission data, submit your application.

Your application is now submitted to Prime Launch and the evaluation process will start shortly. It takes 5-10 days for a project to be reviewed. You will be contacted as soon as the process has finalized. 

## Evaluation Process

Official Prime Launches are curated by PrimeDAO to ensure all listed projects are on par with Prime Launch's standards. After submitting the application form, the PrimeDAO-appointed Prime Launch multi-sig will take up to 5 days to approve or deny the submission.

If the launch is approved, it will become visible in the Prime Launch UI, and the project can go ahead and fund the Launch contract. Follow-up information will automatically be sent over to the Launch host. 

If your application is not accepted, consider opening a Prime Forum thread to receive feedback on your application and potentially resubmit your application after incorporating feedback.

## Post Launch

Hosting a Launch on Prime Launch is the start of a longer-term connection between a project and the Prime Network. Depending on the needs of the project, there are several avenues to continue the collaboration. 

See <a href="/documentation/prime-support">Prime Support And Services</a> for details.
